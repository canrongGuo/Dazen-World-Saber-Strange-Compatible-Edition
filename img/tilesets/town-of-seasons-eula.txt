READ THIS CAREFULLY BEFORE INSTALLING OR USING Town of Seasons Tileset Pack

I. Introduction

Thank you for purchasing Town of Seasons Tileset Pack. The contents of this pack were created by Sherman 3D. This pack contains several tile sheets with buildings and objects that can be used to create a town across seasons (spring, summer, autumn, winter).

------------------------------------------------------------

II. How to use this pack

After the Resource Pack, "Town of Seasons Tileset Pack" is completely downloaded to your computer, unzip it and place the folder in your desired location. 

1. If you are using RPG Maker MV, simply open your project folder and add material:
Your project folder location will vary depending on what you specified when you created the game. The default location is in Documents/Games. Click on appropriate sub-folders (img/battlers, img/pictures etc) and copy/paste the material you wish to add.

2. If you are using RPG Maker VX-Ace or older:
Please use the Resource Manager (key shortcut in VX-Ace is F10) to add the resources to your project.

3. Create a new tileset:
Go to the "Tilesets" tab in your database. Create a new tileset ("Change Maximum..."), and simply match the filenames and the tilenames together (City_TileB goes into slot TileB for example). Be sure to adjust the passage settings in here as well.

III. About Resources in this Materials Add-on Pack

The resources in Town of Seasons Tileset Pack are created for use in game development only, using RPG Maker MV. Alternatively, you may also use these materials with other RPG Makers, as long as you have a valid and legal license for both engines.

Limited advertising use is also allowed, in the forms of screenshots, videos and other media used to promote the game. 

For licensing questions not covered by the paragraphs above, please contact us: support@rpgmakerweb.com

Redistribution of material by itself is not allowed, regardless of whether the material is shared in part only or in its entirety. Personal edits of material are allowed, but they may not be shared with others via e-mail, file-hosting services or physical transfer (ex. By placing the material on a CD) – for free or for a price. 

Resources may be packaged with commercial or non-commercial games and shared as long as they are protected via some means of encryption. We are aware that some RPG Maker applications do not allow you to encrypt the resources your game is using. If this is the case with your project, please contact us.

You may not sell or donate the pack to someone else or sell a sub-license for its use. 

In cases of team projects, all members of the team must own their own copy of the pack. In cases of commissions using the pack (such as commissioning edits, maps and/or covers of the material), both parties need to own their own individual copy of the pack. If you have large teams or need to purchase bulk licenses, please contact us and we will try to assist you.
